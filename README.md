# Milagros with React, Instagram API, and Heroku

Milagros is a simple web app presenting some of my personal Instagram data.<br>
Main goal of this project was to learn how some social media API works in connection with ReactJS.<br>
Great emphasis was placed on UX/UI design. The website is fully responsive.<br>
Heroku is used for hosting and the project is based on a Facebook react-app boilerplate.<br>
Front-end is mainly built with ReactJS (ES6 syntax) and CSS3.<br><br>

## Design:
Purpose of the website was more as a challenge and practice for me, rather than a real use project.<br> 
Because of that, design is really straightforward, basically dividing the app into three sections.<br> 
Each of the sections works provided me with different challenges – anything from utilizing npm 
ReactJS packages to CSS3 grid system.<br>
Responsivity was achieved solely by CSS3 and mobile-first approach.<br> 
I avoided using any kind of template system or framework to achieve pixel-perfect result.<br> 
I put a lot of thought into nice-clean UI to cover up the kind of “sandbox” UX.<br><br>
Even though this project isn’t for any customer, I played around with the code a lot to 
make is as efficient as possible:

-All the files are commented and clearly readable.<br>
-React components are logically separated into different modules.<br>
-I tried to use stateful and stateless functions (components) exactly as they should be used.<br>
-I also created a reusable component to make it as DRY as possible.

## What I learned
I learned a lot during this project. Firstly, I improved my thinking in React, 
how to sketch an app and based on it build components. Next, how to build a reusable
components that you can use in other projects, too. Other skill was utilizing npm 
modules from other developers, reading documentation, understanding the module and using it (react-charts).
Probably the biggest challenge was to integrate the Instagram API. In 2015, Instagram radically 
restricted use of the API and without certain permissions, it’s no longer possible to use 
“whatever” data you want to. That’s the reason I use my personal data, to which I can get access. 
However, it’s still limited (use can fetch only a maximum number of posts) and you have to go through many hurdles.
Anyway, It’s been a great experience overall, ReactJS is amazing to work with and it makes 
the programming experience really enjoyable.
